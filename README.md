# nix-sources
A repo to govern nix flake inputs for various repositories in one space.

This is only a PoC right now - but intends to centralise flake inputs, because of 
lazy evaluation sources shouldn't cause an onerous burden on downstream consumers
and should make the layout of what follows what a bit easier.
